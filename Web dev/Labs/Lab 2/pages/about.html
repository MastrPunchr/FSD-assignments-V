                <p>During the early 2000s, Dr. Cheersworth perfected his <span class="highlight">"Jollification Protocol,"</span> a proprietary system of assessment, intervention, and sustained holly jolly cheerfulness that has since been rolled out to corporations, schools, and municipal offices across North America. <span class="satire">While some employees reported temporary jolliness, others discovered an existential appreciation for mandatory cheer they never knew they needed.</span></p>

                <p>Today, <span class="highlight">Jolly Inc.</span> stands as the world's premier provider of professionally manufactured happiness, with a team of certified jolly specialists ready to transform any gray cubicle farm or dreary hallway into a hub of "authentic spontaneity." We believe that with enough enthusiasm and just the right amount of forced participation, anyone can learn to smile on command.</p>
