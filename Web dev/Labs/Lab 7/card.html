                    The brushtail possum is a nocturnal marsupial native to Australia that has become one of the country's most successful invasive species in New Zealand. These arboreal creatures are highly adaptable and can thrive in diverse environments ranging from wet forests to urban areas. Known for their intelligence and curiosity, brushtail possums have thick fur ranging in color from silver-grey to almost black, and possess a distinctive bushy tail.
